# ytmusic-dl

Download music from youtube music! (Or from youtube. I don't care)

Just run `ytmusic-dl [URL]` and it'll download a song, playlist, or album to `~/Music`. If you give it a playlist or album, it'll make a new folder to hold all the songs, and also put an `m3u` file with the correct information for media players.

You can change the target directory by editing `dir.txt`.

`ytmusic-dl` should be installed to `/usr/local/ytmusic-dl`.
